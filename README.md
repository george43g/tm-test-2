This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install the correct versions of npm and node, which have been pinned using Volta. You can find the versions listed in `package.json`

To enforce conventional commits, commitizen & husky git hooks have been set up. Use either `git commit` or `git cz` to contribute commits before pushing.

Once you have run `npm install`, set up your API key for TheMovieDB in `.env.local`. A sample file `sample.env.local` has been provided for reference.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The default `hello.ts` endpoint has been removed, and replaced with a `movies.ts` endpoint.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deployment

Simply merging or pushing changes onto the main branch will trigger a deployment with Vercel. This was chosen as a simple and fast solution to get this test up and running given limited time.
